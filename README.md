# TrillPong
A Simple pong game in C#/.NET

There will be two player sticks, the game ball, and all the UI that comes with a pong game, mainly score
At least one player stick will be player controlled and I may have the player be able to choose between playing against AI or a human player. This means I will need game states such as the game, lost, and options menu with appropriate UI for each
